# sbi-simulation-tutorials 
📚 Overview

This repository provides hands-on tutorials for Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) using the sbi Python library.
Each tutorial walks through a key workflow—from defining simulators and priors, to training neural posteriors, to evaluating inference quality.

Whether you are new to SBI or want reproducible examples for research, this repo gives you clean, minimal, and well-documented notebooks.

✨ What’s inside
📝 Jupyter Notebooks

Each notebook focuses on one major SBI concept:

Tutorial	Description
01_basic_npe.ipynb	Intro to Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) with a toy simulator.
02_multiple_parameters.ipynb	SBI for multi-dimensional parameter inference.
03_snre.ipynb	Neural Ratio Estimation (SNRE) for likelihood-free inference.
04_nlf.ipynb	Normalizing flows and density estimation details.
05_amortized_inference.ipynb	Amortized inference across many observations.
06_posterior_sampling.ipynb	How to sample and visualize trained posteriors.
07_diagnostics.ipynb	Calibration, coverage, and diagnostics for SBI.
08_custom_simulator.ipynb	How to integrate your own scientific simulator.
09_mcmc_from_posterior.ipynb	MCMC sampling using learned posteriors.

✔️ All notebooks include comments, diagrams, and visualizations.
✔️ Each tutorial runs independently.
